What problem is it trying to solve?\n*   **What context is it being used in:** Where will it be implemented or used? Are there any specific environments, software versions, or hardware it needs to work with?\n\nFor example, instead of asking \"Does this work?\", ask:\n\n*   \"Does this Python code snippet, intended to calculate the factorial of a number, work correctly for positive integers up to 10?\"\n*   \"Does this air conditioner, installed in a 200 square foot room, work to effectively cool the room to 72 degrees Fahrenheit on a 90 degree day?\"\n*   \"Does this algorithm work to sort a list of 10,000 random numbers in ascending order within 1 second?\"\n\nThe more details you provide, the better I can understand your question and give you a helpful answer. I can help with code, concepts, or even general logic, but I need the specifics!\n"
